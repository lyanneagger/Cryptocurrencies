# CryptoCurrencies

## Overview of Project

This analysis compares and classifies different cryptocurrency companies to provide the team at Accountability Accounting with information to create cryptocurrency investment portfolios for its customers. 

## Results

The initial dataset was cleaned to remove cryptocurrencies not currently being traded and anything with null values. Anything not currently being mined was also removed. From that point, Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce the many features down to 3, and those 3 were used to classify the different cryptocurrencies into 4 groups.

Plotly and hvPlot were used to plot the different groups, as pictured below.
